					It is great when you find someone that shares your views on human rights
					and is willing to put their time and effort in improving what they saw as
					injustice. This happened many years ago with Anna, Tatiana, Catia, and
					Andreia. Thus, we took the lead and registered Stichting CAAT Projects in
					January 2016. We started our operations in The Hague, together with other
					organizations, like the The Hague Youth Factory. Years later we moved our
					operational centre to Amsterdam, to the OT301 building, in a close
					cooperation with Home of Participation.
					The social actors in CAAT have changed and we now we have integrated
					other colleagues as Marik and Tom, as well as David, Marzieh and Joe in our
					board. We have also the pleasure of collaborating with an enthusiastic group
					of volunteers and friends.
					Despite the changes in location and team, our core value continues the same
					– human rights for all. We will keep on building an impressive record of
					successful projects in the Netherlands and abroad, achieving the goals set in
					the organizational planning. Moreover, CAAT Projects has also been
					delivering on the requirements of the EU funded projects and bringing
					people together from various backgrounds.
					Our door keeps on being open to new opportunities, projects and
					collaboration either with organizations or individuals. If you think you share
					similar values than us, contact us and we would brainstorm together.
