                            Andreia – with 20 years’ experience in the field and with the privilege of learning with extraordinary 
                            groups and professionals. Now is time to pass these competences to others, by being a trainer, an activist 
                            and a coordinator of projects. Her social-psychological background reinforces the importance of building 
                            meaningful and last connections as well as the need to humanize our society. Andreia describes herself as 
                            a dreamer with an high sense of pragmatism.

                    It is great when you find someone that shares your views on human rights and is willing to put their 
                    time and effort in improving what they saw as injustice. This happened many years ago with Anna and Andreia. 
                    Others have joined and after a few actions together we decided that we would form an organization. 
                    Thus, Anna, Andreia, Catia and Tatiana took the lead and registered Stichting CAAT Projects in January 2016. 
                    We started our operations in The Hague, together with other organizations, like the The Hague Youth Factory 
                    and a couple of other ones. Years later we moved our operational centre to Amsterdam, to the OT301 building. 
                    The social actors in CAAT have changed and we now we have integrated other colleagues as Steve and Kim in our 
                    board. We have also the pleasure of collaborating with an enthusiastic group of volunteers and friends. 
                    Despite the changes in location and team, our core value continues the same – human rights for all. We will 
                    keep on building an impressive record of successful projects in the Netherlands and abroad, achieving the goals 
                    set in the organizational planning. Moreover, CAAT Projects has also been delivering on the requirements of 
                    the EU funded projects and bringing people together from various backgrounds. 
                    Our door keeps on being open to new opportunities, projects and collaboration either with organizations or 
                    individuals. If you think you share similar values than us, contact us and we would brainstorm together.
