					We believe in the potential that we have, individually and collectively, to build a fair world for all. 
					The world is complex and we can look into it from many different perspectives. 
					For us it is important to understand and reflect about the roots of the things we would like to change, 
					rather than a superficial understanding of it. In practice, this means discussing concepts as decolonization, 
					privilege, fragilities, intersectionality, empathy and critical thinking. It can be overwhelming to understand 
					how rooted and systemic injustices are, thus we use participatory arts methodologies, 
					emphasizing a safe and playful environment. Moreover, we also address possibility 
					for actions and in sharing tools we get familiar with. We have been collaborating with some research projects 
					with the aim to create MOOCs (https://www.informa-giovani.net/mooc.html), toolkits (http://tacklehate.eu/)
					and DIY guidelines (Counter and Alternatives Narratives – to be published soon).

					Human rights should be guaranteed for all, although it is not yet the case. 
					Some groups do not have many opportunities to participate in decision making process or even be heard. 
					We want to correct this and reduce imbalances in power relations in our societies.Representativeness is important. 
					We cannot understand others if we do not listen to them. We want to facilitate spaces and opportunities 
					for a plurality of voices. Whether in international projects co-funded by Europe for Citizens and Erasmus 
					plus or in local events that we host, we always make an effort to bring different people together and we 
					practice active listening. We share personal stories and we connect with each other. Moreover, 
					with the art creation events, we share some tools for expressing ourselves. All voices matter, 
					especially the ones that have been traditionally oppressed. 
					One example of this was our direct collaboration with the project Youth UnMuted ( https://www.youthunmuted.org/).

				<p class="goals_subtitle">Train the community and youth leaders</p>
				<p class="goals_text2">
					We believe that we can achieve our goals by supporting those who work with young people and communities develop their own thinking 
					and action. We mainly use non-formal education and human rights education. They have similar principles and
					there are both based on experiential learning and centered on the learner. 
					We do like to spice our trainings with a dynamic/interactive designed based on arts and inviting a playfulness approach, 
					especially when we do address complicated issues. 
					It is a privilege to organize and deliver trainings. We learn and grow together with the communities and local leaders. 
					In this way we keep on being connected. Moreover, we have the possibility for developing our approaches to be more adapted 
					to the current reality. We host local workshops frequently with other professionals that we admire, 
					and we do also international trainings, within Europe. Most of the international trainings are co-funded by Erasmus Plus
					and the Council of Europe. 
				</p>

				<p class="goals_subtitle">Build long term and sustainable changes</p>
				<p class="goals_text2">
					We are not focused on treating the symptoms but in acting on the root of the social challenge. 
					In this way we know that our (sometimes baby) steps are going in the direction we want and will produce long lasting results.
					That justifies the choices of our topics inside the human rights frame. 
					One of the first projects we had the pleasure to be partners with was “Revealing Colonialism”, 
					coordinated by Europäische Jugendbildungs-und Jugendbegegnungsstätte Weimar. 
					This experience has shaped some of the choices. For example, we not only on social topics, 
					but also in facilitating a strong self-reflection and personal development processes, 
					both with the professionals we work with as well as within our team. 
				</p>

				<p class="goals_subtitle">Promote art and culture</p>
				<p class="goals_text2">
					We believe in creativity and the power of imagination, at a personal development level as well as tools for a 
					collective transformation. There are other ways, but in our experience arts and creativity are 
					great tools to engage a wider spectrum of individuals. It helps us to work symbolically with our reality 
					and identify different possibilities to our problems, by using different intelligences and skills. 
					Thus, participatory arts methods are more inclusive. Moreover, they are more fun and enjoyable to work with. 
					And extra motivation is always welcomed. Art and culture should be accessible to all. 
					They are essential elements for our collective well-being. Thus, we do partner with other organizations 
					and artists who share this idea, to create events accessible to all. 
					A few examples of this activity are the active collaboration with OT301 (http://www.ot301.nl/) in Amsterdam, 
					that we are part of, our collaboration with Formaat and the “Shadows of the City” theatrical play and exhibition, 
					and our active collaboration with HoP (https://homeofparticipation.art/) in theatre/performances 
					and research projects as the project Urban ParticipArt (urbanparticipart.eu). 

				</p>

				<p class="goals_subtitle">Promote multiculturalism and diversity</p>
				<p class="goals_text2">
					The value of a colourful society that embraces different perspectives is something we believe in. 
					While it does bring challenges, these are far less important than its potential. 
					We work to contain the challenges and to reinforce the beauty of a diverse world. 
					This is the base for our choice to work with human rights education. The impact we would like to achieve 
					is a world of humanity and solidarity, where we display acceptance towards others. 
					This goal is connected with all others and central to our actions – to involve a diverse group of people, 
					promote a plurality of voices, encourage the acceptance of others, chose methods that are more inclusive.

					We support methodologies that have a horizontal power structure, where we all can contribute to the process and result. 
					These methods encourage participation from everyone involved and has the potential to reveal a lot of talents we were not 
					aware of. Our preference goes to methods that cultivate our creativity and makes us explore different ways of 
					communication - theater, music, storytelling, poems, drawing, photo & video, circus, etc. Moreover, the use of 
					diverse languages opens the way for inclusivity. It brings new opportunities for participation to diverse groups. 
					Additionally, it is lovely to witness the creation of the collective story as a process of dialogue and compromise 
					between the different elements of the group. It brings us together and brightens our imagination.

			<div class="col-sm-5">
				<p class="goals_text2">
					We believe in the power on non-formal education as a method that is centered on the participant and flexible enough to 
					be adapted to a wide spectrum of learners. In this way we can be more inclusive and address different types of 
					intelligences. Non-formal education starts from the experiential point of view, where we learn by doing and we 
					also learn how to learn and properly integrate our meaningful daily experiences. We are always learning and 
					growing together. It is also a more dynamic and potentially joyfull method. Human Rights Education shares most 
					of its principles with non-formal education. It differs on the emphasis on the need to recognize the (lack of) 
					human rights and our duty to ensure that those are available to all. We see human rights education as essential 
					to promote balanced societies. For that reason we are part of the HREYN (Human Rights Education Youth 
					Network - https://www.hreyn.net/) and working on human rights education advocacy training courses financed by the CoE.

					In the arts there is no right or wrong. It is a symbolic language that supports us in a journey to explore and 
					find alternatives. It helps us to embrace our vulnerability and transform it into strength. Every child is an 
					artist and we tend to neglect this capability when we become adults. However, we find it important to get those 
					skills and attitudes back. Thus, some of our projects are an invitation to play again, to create freely, to use 
					our imagination and to look into reality through various lenses. 
					One example of a project we created together with AddArt is a participatory storytelling event, when spectators can decide how the 
					story develops in real time. It is a fantasy story but with the potential to foster really interesting discussions about the best ways 
					to integrate refugees.

					We embrace programs that take into account knowledge, skills and values, taking into consideration the context, 
					social and personal factors so that participants can find their own way forwards. For this reason, we integrate 
					non-formal methodologies, which focus on the development of competences; participatory methodologies that 
					takes into account needs, interest and the local realities of the participants and artistic tools that helps 
					us explore other possibilities and dimensions of our development.

				<p class="goals_text2">
					It is essential to be critical about ourselves and our work too. Thus, we find it important to have an external 
					officer that monitor and evaluates the work developed. Sometimes it is our role in partner projects, other times 
					we invite partners or volunteer to assist us with this task. In our opinion, it is the best way to learn from 
					practice, improve ourselves and ensure we are going in the right direction. In our latest international trainings, 
					co-funded by Erasmus plus, we have incorporated in our team a MEL officer – as it is the case of 
					CARE - Complex Activation of Resilience is Essential’s project.
