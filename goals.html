					We believe in the potential that we have, individually and collectively, to build a fair world for all. 
					The world is complex and we can look into it from many different perspectives. 
					For us it is important to understand and reflect about the roots of the things we would like to change, 
					rather than a superficial understanding of it. In practice, this means discussing concepts as decolonization, 
					privilege, fragilities, intersectionality, empathy and critical thinking. It can be overwhelming to understand 
					how rooted and systemic injustices are, thus we use participatory arts methodologies, 
					emphasizing a safe and playful environment. Moreover, we also address possibility 
					for actions and in sharing tools we get familiar with. We have been collaborating with some research projects 
					with the aim to create MOOCs (https://www.informa-giovani.net/mooc.html), toolkits (http://tacklehate.eu/)
					and DIY guidelines (Counter and Alternatives Narratives – to be published soon).

					Human rights should be guaranteed for all, although it is not yet the case. 
					Some groups do not have many opportunities to participate in decision making process or even be heard. 
					We want to correct this and reduce imbalances in power relations in our societies.Representativeness is important. 
					We cannot understand others if we do not listen to them. We want to facilitate spaces and opportunities 
					for a plurality of voices. Whether in international projects co-funded by Europe for Citizens and Erasmus 
					plus or in local events that we host, we always make an effort to bring different people together and we 
					practice active listening. We share personal stories and we connect with each other. Moreover, 
					with the art creation events, we share some tools for expressing ourselves. All voices matter, 
					especially the ones that have been traditionally oppressed. 
					One example of this was our direct collaboration with the project Youth UnMuted ( https://www.youthunmuted.org/).

				<p class="goals_subtitle">Train the community and youth leaders</p>
				<p class="goals_text2">
					We believe that we can achieve our goals by supporting those who work with young people and communities develop their own thinking 
					and action. We mainly use non-formal education and human rights education. They have similar principles and
					there are both based on experiential learning and centered on the learner. 
					We do like to spice our trainings with a dynamic/interactive designed based on arts and inviting a playfulness approach, 
					especially when we do address complicated issues. 
					It is a privilege to organize and deliver trainings. We learn and grow together with the communities and local leaders. 
					In this way we keep on being connected. Moreover, we have the possibility for developing our approaches to be more adapted 
					to the current reality. We host local workshops frequently with other professionals that we admire, 
					and we do also international trainings, within Europe. Most of the international trainings are co-funded by Erasmus Plus
					and the Council of Europe.

				<p class="goals_subtitle">Build long term and sustainable changes</p>
				<p class="goals_text2">
					We are not focused on treating the symptoms but in acting on the root of the social challenge. 
					In this way we know that our (sometimes baby) steps are going in the direction we want and will produce long lasting results.
					That justifies the choices of our topics inside the human rights frame. 
					One of the first projects we had the pleasure to be partners with was “Revealing Colonialism”, 
					coordinated by Europäische Jugendbildungs-und Jugendbegegnungsstätte Weimar. 
					This experience has shaped some of the choices. For example, we not only on social topics, 
					but also in facilitating a strong self-reflection and personal development processes, 
					both with the professionals we work with as well as within our team. 
				</p>

				<p class="goals_subtitle">Promote art and culture</p>
				<p class="goals_text2">
					We believe in creativity and the power of imagination, at a personal development level as well as tools for a 
					collective transformation. There are other ways, but in our experience arts and creativity are 
					great tools to engage a wider spectrum of individuals. It helps us to work symbolically with our reality 
					and identify different possibilities to our problems, by using different intelligences and skills. 
					Thus, participatory arts methods are more inclusive. Moreover, they are more fun and enjoyable to work with. 
					And extra motivation is always welcomed. Art and culture should be accessible to all. 
					They are essential elements for our collective well-being. Thus, we do partner with other organizations 
					and artists who share this idea, to create events accessible to all. 
					A few examples of this activity are the active collaboration with OT301 (http://www.ot301.nl/) in Amsterdam, 
					that we are part of, our collaboration with Formaat and the “Shadows of the City” theatrical play and exhibition, 
					and our active collaboration with HoP (https://homeofparticipation.art/) in theatre/performances 
					and research projects as the project Urban ParticipArt (urbanparticipart.eu). 

				</p>

				<p class="goals_subtitle">Promote multiculturalism and diversity</p>
				<p class="goals_text2">
					The value of a colourful society that embraces different perspectives is something we believe in. 
					While it does bring challenges, these are far less important than its potential. 
					We work to contain the challenges and to reinforce the beauty of a diverse world. 
					This is the base for our choice to work with human rights education. The impact we would like to achieve 
					is a world of humanity and solidarity, where we display acceptance towards others. 
					This goal is connected with all others and central to our actions – to involve a diverse group of people, 
					promote a plurality of voices, encourage the acceptance of others, chose methods that are more inclusive.
